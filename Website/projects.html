		<h1>My Projects</h1>

		<p>Projects I've worked on to improve and express my goals of becoming a software developer.
		These projects range from algorithms, data structures, web development, application development and mainly gaming development. Gaming development has been a recent pleasure I found. I've added a detail to these projects as well as photos to display how they work and why I chose to make them.</p>
