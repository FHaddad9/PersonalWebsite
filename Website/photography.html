		<h1>My photographs</h1>

		<p>For a while now, I've gotten a growing interest in photography and capturing the scenes of what mostly is nature. I started off after being influenced by a friend and decided to start my journey into taking photos. At first I was nervous to think an ordinary scene wouldn't be interesting or worth a photo. However, as I took more and more photos, I became more and more passionate and experienced. I even learned that taking a photo can be so ordinary, yet could be so artistic!</p>

		<br>

		<p>I now mostly take photos of scenery and if at all rarely edit them. Why do I capture these scenes in particlar? I just see it and think that it could be worth a shot. You could ask yourself why an artist like Turner chose to paint wild and natural landscapes. It must be feeling he got when he first witnessed his scenes and quickly decided that they must be painted!</p>
